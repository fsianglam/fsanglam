BERLIN BINGO
Welcome to the AnglAm BERLIN BINGO
Since we have all aged about five decades during the pandemic, we felt like it was time to act our age and play a round of BINGO - but since we’re all sick of the insides of our rooms, we decided to make the board bigger and better to get you to explore Berlin.
That’s when we came up with the idea of BERLIN BINGO – the whole city is part of the game, and everybody can join in.
