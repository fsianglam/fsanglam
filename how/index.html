  <h2 id="how-to-play">How to play</h2>

<p>Here’s how it works: We have created a BINGO-Board with a number of clues on it - the solutions are all locations within Berlin city limits. Your job (as <strong>a single person or a group of up to four</strong> people) is to <strong>solve the clue, visit the location and take a picture</strong> with it – either of you(r group) or of your group mascot. You can then <strong>upload the picture</strong> to the corresponding square on the board – and maybe win a prize. <br />
You can upload boards until <strong>October 31st at noon</strong> - after that, the jury will deliberate and the winners will be announced on the page at <strong>6pm</strong>.  <br />
<strong>Everyone who submits a board gets a bounty for participating!</strong></p>

<p><strong>There will be three different prize categories</strong>, one with three winners and the other with one winner each. The categories are as follows: <br />
<strong>First, second and third (group) to get a BINGO</strong> (horizontal / vertical / diagonal line with all letters included)</p>

<p><strong>First (group) to complete the full board</strong></p>

<p><strong>Creative Prize:</strong> This one is pretty open to interpretation. You may win with a single picture, or with what you did with your whole board. Be creative!</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hlcpYT5othJcqNj529VsNBJRRHt87E9D6x7RlvEr-t8/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> you find a google doc with the BINGO board template. You now have to make a copy of it which you can edit - to do this, go to files &gt; make a copy.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to use Google, <a href="https://box.hu-berlin.de/f/c90423e69baf40cdbf81/?dl=1">here’s</a> a direct download</p>

<p>You can edit the template directly in Google Slides or, if you don’t have a Google account, you can download the board as a Powerpoint presentation. LibreOffice and OpenOffice are free alternatives to Microsoft Office.</p>

<p>Once you have your own copy, you can start replacing the prompts with the photos you took. To do that, you just right click on the prompt you want to fulfill and select ‘replace image’.</p>

<p>When you are satisfied with your board, you can (download and) submit it. To download, go to files &gt; download as / save as &gt; Microsoft Powerpoint (.pptx). Then you go to the SUBMIT tab on this Website and submit your board.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations, you did it!</strong></p>
