 ## How to play 

General bingo rules, specific rules we want to have followed for our thing


## How to get, edit and submit your bingo board 

Click on [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15JNROkP5hEKqj8FT10v7BiQ7l6xoQaJhc0Q55r6_bCM/edit?usp=sharing) to open the google doc
with the bingo board template.

Now make a copy of the board so you can edit it and add your own pictures. To make a copy go to files > make a copy.

If you dont have a google account you can also download the bingo board as a powerpoint presentation. The Humboldt University has a reduced office key which
can be found [here](https://www.cms.hu-berlin.de/de/dl/multimedia/bereiche/dmp/dmpblog/6efb498b4595e1a05efdf6d9317f3ea2) alternatively LibreOffice and OpenOffice 
are free alternatives. You are free to edit the template any other way you want to insert the pictures.

The rest of this instruction set assumes that you are editing in google slides, 

Once you have your own copy you can start replacing the prompts you fullfilled with the pictures you took. To do that right click on the picture and
select `replace image`.

Finally you still have to resize the image so it is fully visible (maybe we can skip that step by having the text pictures be exactly the size of our squares?)
In order to do that right click on the image, select resize image (if we do this repeat the picture from above with a different arrow) and use the appearing black
bars to resize which portion of your image is shown.

When you are satisfied and have achieved a bingo you can download your bingo board and submit it to us. To download the file you can go to files > download and
(we should pick what format the file should be). Then go to the submit tab and submit your bingo board. +

Congratulation! You have done it!
